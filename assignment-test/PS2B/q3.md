This question is about q3.gdb from Part A

Assume that `rax=0xdeadbeefdeadbeef`, `rbx=0xfeedfacebadf00d`, `rip=_start` and that memory has been initialized by your `q3` gdb command.
Answer the following assuming that two instruction steps are executed. All numeric values should be given in hex, base 16,  notation.

Q3.1
What is the value of `rax`? Skip leading zero and do not prefix your answer.  Eg. if you think the value is `00000000000dead` in hex then your answer would be `dead`

[____](deadbeefdeadbeef)


Q3.2
What is the value of `rbx`? Skip leading zero and do not prefix your answer.  Eg. if you think the value is `00000000000dead` in hex then your answer would be `dead`

[____](30)

Q3.3
